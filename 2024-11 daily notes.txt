			I never used IR, but I have my own version of IR. I’ll read a book on kindle and split screen it with RemNote. I’ll use Adler’s method of reading a book. And write notes. I’ll do close deletions for what I think I’ll want in my long term memory. The problem with IR is that there’s no elaboration methods except reading an article and using cloze deletions. It’s better to summarize in your own words and ask questions about it. You’re creating better encoding and then use cloze deletions for SRS rather than just using articles and using extractions.
